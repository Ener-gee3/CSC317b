HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment
Description:
The assignment is to create a basic HTML portfolio website. The objective was to present a clear and concise portfolio showcasing my projects, experience, and education. Initially for internship applications, and later for full-time job opportunities in tech. 
Approach / What I Did:
I created semantic sections such as <header>, <main>, <footer> to organize the page. I used <nav> for navigation and <section>/<article> for grouping content. I created a simple, clean layout that avoids using external CSS at this current time.
Code Explanation:
Highlight key parts of your HTML code and explain their purpose. Use code blocks for clarity.
<header>
  <h1>Chadd Holman</h1>
  <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Chadd Holman" class="profile-image img-fluid rounded-circle" style="max-width: 200px;">
</header>
I used a family photo for the class, however, once the site is ready to be presented for application purposes, It will be replaced with a professional photo
